abstract: "Communication using mid-ultraviolet radiation between 200nm and 280nm has received renewed attention due to advancements in UV LED emitters and unique propagation characteristics at these wavelengths. Atmospheric gases absorb light at mid-UV so that receivers or sensors operating on the earth’s surface receive no interference from solar radiation. This so-called “solar-blind” region of the spectrum allows the use of single-photon detection techniques. Further, UV light is strongly scattered by molecules in the air, enabling non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication. We extend previous work in this area by incorporating angle-dependent Mie scattering into one of the standard propagation models, in an effort to include the effects of aerosols. Experimental results from outdoor measurements using a fog generator are also presented."
